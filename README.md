In week 1, we will use Git and Github to keep track of changes in the 
process of full stack development. I am attaching a book which is 
available on <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git website </a>, to get to 
know everything about Git.

<h2>Week 2</h2>

In week 4, we will use PHP to validate form on server-side. With PHP and 
MySQL we will design a database. This will allow us to insert, update, 
delete and search for values in the database. (Sources:
