In week 4, we will use PHP to validate form on server-side. With PHP and 
MySQL we will design a database. This will allow us to insert, update, 
delete and search for values in the database. 


To run php and mysql server, we need a locally hosted server. We will use
[Xampp server](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
to create our database. After installing it, "start" the Apache Module and 
MySQL Module in Xampp Control Panel. It will start the services needed 
to run a server on local host.


Place the php files in C:/xampp/htdocs folder (Windows) to run php files.

To access database type the URL: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/

To access files type the URL: localhost

In week 5, we will use React Js to create a webpage for realtime calculations.


To run react server we will use some commands to initialize a react application.

```
npx create-react-app week5
cd week5
npm start 
```

App connects to localhost at URL: http://localhost:3000
